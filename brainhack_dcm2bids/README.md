# Overview

DICOMS are converted into Niftis, which are renamed and put into BIDS structure using [cbedetti](https://github.com/cbedetti)'s [dcm2Bids](https://github.com/cbedetti/Dcm2Bids) package. The dcm2Bids package converts DICOM files to Nifti files using the [rordenlab](https://github.com/rordenlab)'s [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix) package, then renames and relocates them as per [BIDS](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/) specifications.

**_Instructions on this page are to run batches of subjects on a high performance cluster running SLURM using a Singularity container of the dcm2Bids package - or - to run the subjects serially on a local machine._**

# What You Need

* **Dcm2Bids singularity container** (exists at `/projects/sanlab/shared/containers/Dcm2Bids-master.simg`)
  * If you need a copy of the container to exist elsewhere, see [Containers: Docker & Singularity](https://uosanlab.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SW/pages/45285423) (and, as always, read the [documentation](http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-build-container))
  * Note that if you create a new container, you either need to give it the same name ( Dcm2Bids-master.simg ) or change the image name in the `config_dcm2bids_batch.py` script.

The following files should be in a single directory (e.g. [REV_scripts/org/dcm2bids](https://github.com/UOSAN/REV_scripts/tree/master/org/dcm2bids)). You can pull them from the [git repo](https://github.com/kdestasio/dcm2bids). After you clone the repo, copy the "dcm2bids" directory into your own "StudyName_scripts/org" folder, and remove the hidden .git directory within that directory using the following code:

```
cd StudyName_scripts/org/dcm2bids

rm -rf .git
```

### [Scripts](https://github.com/kdestasio/dcm2bids)

- **dcm2bids_helper.py**  
- **config_dcm2bids_helper.py** - change the variables and paths as   appropriate for your study
- **dcm2bids_batch.py**
- **config_dcm2bids_batch.py**- change the variables and paths as appropriate for your study  
- **subject_list.txt** - populate this text file with a list of subjects you want to convert.  
- **study_config.json** - the study config file (instructions on how to make it for your study are [here](https://github.com/cbedetti/Dcm2Bids))  

# Make the configuration file
## Using the Dcm2Bids_helper

If you need the metadata to populate the config file, use the dcm2bids helper, which is built into the dcm2bids container.

### Run the helper locally

Use cbdetti's built in command line tool:

`dcm2bids_helper -d DICOM_DIR [-o OUTPUT_DIR]`

Run the helper on the HPC

1. If you are planning to run the script on data stored on the high performance cluster (HPC), change the variables and/or paths in the `config_dcm2bids_helper.py` script for your study  

2. Log into the HPC

`ssh -X username``@Talapas``-ln1.uoregon.edu`

4. `cd` to the directory that has your code in it

5. Load the python3 module 

`module load python3`

6. Run the `dcm2bids_helper.py` script

`python3 dcm2bids_helper.py`

7. `cd` to the folder created by the helper (should be in the top level of your study directory), e.g. 

```
cd /projects/sanlab/shared/REV/tmp_dcm2bids/helper

ls


>>> 001_REV001_20150406_AAHScout_20150406145550.nii.gz

>>> 02_REV001_20150406_AAHScout_20150406145550a.json

>>> . 

>>> .

>>> .

>>> 017_REV001_20150406_React2_mb3_g2_2mm_te27_20150406145550.json

>>> 017_REV001_20150406_React2_mb3_g2_2mm_te27_20150406145550.nii.gz
```

8. View the json files and use that info to edit the config file so it works for your study. Instructions in the readme of the [dcm2Bids](https://github.com/cbedetti/Dcm2Bids) repo.

# Steps to convert DICOMS to BIDS

1. Create the `subject_list.txt` where each row has the input: `directoryName,subjectID,waveNumber`
    * An easy way to do this is to `cd` into your DICOM directory and use the command `ls >> subject_list.txt` , which will create a text file of that name and populate it with all the directories/files in your working directory. You can then move that subject_list.txt file to the directory from which you will be running your code and add the subject ID and time-point columns.
    * The subject_list should be formatted such that each row consists of: the subject directory names (that contains the dicoms), desired subject ID, and data collection wave number. Each field is comma separated, all without spaces, e.g.:

    `sub01_20150909,REV001,wave1`

    `sub01_20150909,REV001,wave2`

    `sub02_20150909,REV001,wave1`

2. Edit the `study_config.json` file such that it works for your study.
    - See the [dcm2Bids](https://github.com/cbedetti/Dcm2Bids) repository for documentation and instructions. ‚Üê for real, you'll need to read the instructions
3. Change the variables and/or paths in `config_``dcm2bids_batch.py` script for your study
    - Select whether the jobs are to be run serially on a local machine or in parallel on a HPC
4. Log into the HPC if not running locally

  `ssh -X username@Talapas-ln1.uoregon.edu`

5. `cd` to the directory that has your code in it. 
6. Load the python3 module (if on HPC). 

  `module load python3`. 

7. Run the batch script. 

  `python3 dcm2bids_batch.py`. 

8. Check the niftis, output logs, and error logs.

# Manually Create Metadata Files

As per: [http://bids.neuroimaging.io/bids\_spec1.0.0-rc2.pdf](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/bids_spec1.0.0-rc2.pdf)

Place these files in the top level bids directory.

* dataset_description.json
* phasediff.json
* A JSON for each functional task with TaskName and RepetitionTime
* README (optional, but strongly recommended)
* CHANGES (optional, but strongly recommended)
